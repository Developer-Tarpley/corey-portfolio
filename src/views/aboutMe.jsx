          Full-Stack graduate from Persevere,
          self motivated and ready to succeed.
          Throughout my learning stages I have built
          numerous projects, some personal projects
          and some team projects.
          I am always looking to learn new languages and 
          to learn from experienced software developers
           to help myself grow into an outstanding
          software engineer.
